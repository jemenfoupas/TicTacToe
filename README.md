## Overview
this program is a Tic-tac-toe game, it allows the player to select a box and then 
if the player can match the boxes whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, the 
player would be the winner.

## Reflection
this activity was interesting, it allows me to practice using 2D arrays and more.
I was a little confuse at the beginning but ones I got what this project was asking
I was able to get stated.

the 2D arrays were the hardest thing about this project but with help from the tutor 
I got a good understanding of it.

## Compiling and Using
To compile all that the user needs to do is press the run button on the top bar 
if they are running the code on eclipse. ones that is done they can only need to select
the boxes that they want and just play the game.

If the user goes trough the console they can compile and run the application
by running the command:
javac TicTacToeGUI.java
java TicTacToeGUI

ones that is done they can only need to select the boxes that they want and just play the game.

## Sources used
I only used my previous activities, projects, google slides and 
the tutors to get the project done.
